## ðŸ“Œ Task 4 â€“ Spam Message Classifier  

Classify SMS messages as *spam* or *ham (legitimate)* using Natural Language Processing.  

### Dataset  
- SMS dataset labeled as spam/ham (spam.csv).  
- Preprocessing includes:  
  - Lowercasing text  
  - Removing punctuation & stopwords  
  - Tokenization  
  - TF-IDF vectorization (up to 5000 features, uni- & bi-grams)  

### Model  
- Logistic Regression (with balanced class weights).  

### Results
